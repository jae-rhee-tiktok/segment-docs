[Tiktok's Offline Events API](https://ads.tiktok.com/marketing_api/docs?id=1758049779688450) helps advertisers measure how TikTok ads result in offline customer actions, such as in-store purchases or offline subscriptions, purchases and more. Attributing online and offline events is an important step for advertisers to measure omni-channel results from their campaigns. 

**Benefits**
- **Measure how TikTok ads influence offline conversions.** Learn what online strategies lead to better Brick & Mortar sales, subscription sign-ups or leads. 
- **Power holistic attribution models with cross-channel event tracking.** Combine online and offline touchpoints to get comprehensive campaign metrics, like ROAS.
- **Reach offline customers online with custom audiences.** Promote new products or services to high-value customers who initiative offline events.

- iOS compliance checks will be performed on PII (ATT opt-out users will still be reported and attributed).
- TikTok will pruge unmatched offline conversions IDs/records.
